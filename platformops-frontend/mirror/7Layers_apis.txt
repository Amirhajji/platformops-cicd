FIRST — CORE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR BACKEND

Your backend is not a generic monitoring backend.
It has three unique properties that define everything:

🔴 1. Timeseries is JSONB-payload based (wide metrics)

One row = one tick per component

Payload = all xi / yi / zi metrics

Signals are metadata views over payload keys

👉 UI must be signal-centric, not table-centric.

🔴 2. Health is NOT a metric — it is COMPUTED

Component health = aggregation of yi signals

Global health = GLOBAL.z9_collapse_risk

👉 UI must never fake health curves
Only show what backend computes.

🔴 3. Anomalies are FIRST-CLASS OPERATIONS

They physically modify timeseries payload

They create SIMULATED alerts

They affect health and incidents downstream

👉 This is not observability only
👉 This is control + experimentation

NOW — RE-LOCKING THE 7 MODULES (BACKEND-FAITHFUL)

Below is the corrected, exact, feasible interpretation of:

0 → 6 narrative stack


Every feature below is backed by real endpoints you pasted.

🟢 MODULE 0 — GLOBAL CONTROL ROOM (Mission View)
WHAT IT IS (re-defined precisely)

A read-only, global operational snapshot built from analytics + system + alerts + anomalies.

BACKEND INPUTS (ONLY THESE)

/api/analytics/global-health

/api/analytics/system-stats

/api/analytics/alerts-stats

/api/analytics/active-hotspots

/api/anomalies/active

/api/anomalies/impact

WHAT IT SHOWS (NO INVENTION)
A. Global Health State

collapse_risk

status: STABLE / DEGRADED / CRITICAL

B. System Ingestion Reality

(from system-stats)

total ingested rows

components count

tick range

latest tick per component

👉 This proves simulator + ingestion health

C. Operational Pressure

(from alerts-stats)

open alerts by severity

longest open alerts

top components by alert count

D. Active Anomaly Banner

(from anomalies/active)

simulation ON/OFF

affected components

total modified points

E. Hotspots

(from active-hotspots)

signals currently driving instability

📌 NO charts for beauty
📌 Only counters, rankings, timelines

🧭 MODULE 1 — SYSTEM TOPOLOGY & CHAINS VIEW
WHAT IT IS

A structural health map, not metrics.

BACKEND INPUTS

/api/system/overview

/api/system/components

/api/alerts/by-component/{component}

/api/analytics/component-health/{component}

WHAT IT SHOWS

For each component node:

health_score

status (OK / DEGRADED / CRITICAL)

active_alerts count

👉 Topology is STATIC
👉 Health & alert density are DYNAMIC

No propagation arrows here — just structure + state

🧠 MODULE 2 — COMPONENT INTELLIGENCE LAYER
WHAT IT IS

A deep diagnostic page per component

BACKEND INPUTS

/api/system/components/{component}

/api/analytics/component-health/{component}

/api/analytics/component-time-analysis/{component}

/api/analytics/component-regimes/{component}

/api/analytics/component-stress/{component}

/api/alerts/by-component/{component}

WHAT IT SHOWS
A. Component Identity

role

health score

number of signals

open alerts

B. Time Behavior

(from component-time-analysis)

health evolution over time

degradation windows

C. Regimes

(from component-regimes)

stable vs stressed vs recovery periods

D. Stress Curve

(from component-stress)

response under load accumulation

📌 This page is ENGINEERING-LEVEL
📌 No raw xi spam here — this is interpretation

📈 MODULE 3 — METRICS EXPLORER (Grafana-grade)
WHAT IT IS

The ONLY place where raw metrics are explored

BACKEND INPUTS

/api/signals?role=

/api/timeseries

/api/timeseries/multi

/api/timeseries/aggregate

/api/timeseries/derivative

/api/timeseries/normalized

WHAT IT DOES

Select signals by:

component

family

type (xi / yi)

Plot:

raw

aggregated

derivative

normalized

Overlay multiple signals

📌 This is your Grafana replacement
📌 BUT semantic (signal metadata aware)

🚨 MODULE 4 — ALERTS & INCIDENTS (Operations Core)
WHAT IT IS

The operational truth layer

BACKEND INPUTS

/api/alerts/events

/api/alerts/summary

/api/incidents

/api/incidents/{id}

/api/alerts/evaluate

/api/incidents/evaluate

ALERTS VIEW

OPEN / CLOSED

REAL vs SIMULATED

severity

duration

signal → metric context link

INCIDENTS VIEW

incident lifecycle

component affected

contributing alerts

severity logic (density + duration)

📌 This is PagerDuty-grade logic, not UI fluff

🧪 MODULE 5 — ANOMALIES & IMPACT CONTROL
WHAT IT IS

A controlled chaos engineering panel

BACKEND INPUTS

/api/anomalies/inject

/api/anomalies/active

/api/anomalies/impact

/api/anomalies/analysis

/api/anomalies/rollback

WHAT IT SHOWS
A. Injection Control

pipeline

anomaly type

tick window

strength

B. Active Anomaly Monitor

affected components

affected signals

duration

modified points

C. Impact Analysis

(from anomaly-impact)

alert explosion

component health drops

metric deviation %

📌 This is unique
📌 Very few platforms do this correctly

🧠 MODULE 6 — ANALYTICS, PROPAGATION, NARRATIVES
WHAT IT IS

The explainability layer

BACKEND INPUTS

/api/analytics/volatility

/api/analytics/degradation

/api/analytics/top-risk

/api/analytics/forecast/*

/api/analytics/signal-envelope

/api/analytics/signal-change-impact

/api/propagation

WHAT IT SHOWS

“Why this metric matters”

Change impact before/after pivot

Signal-to-signal propagation evidence

Forecast stress continuation

📌 This is system reasoning, not monitoring

FINAL VERDICT (IMPORTANT)

✅ The 7-layer narrative is VALID
✅ It is 100% compatible with your backend
✅ No fake APIs
✅ No assumptions
✅ No over-promising

What you have is not a toy backend —
it is already stronger than many real internal tools.
